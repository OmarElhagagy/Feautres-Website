# Features Website Backend

## **Overview**
Welcome to the **Features Website Backend**! This project powers a dynamic, feature-rich website with a backend inspired by the functionality of [Chronos](https://chronos.framer.website/). Built with modern tools and hosted on **Azure**, it’s designed to be scalable and efficient. **Note**: This is currently a backend-only implementation—a frontend is in the works!

## **About**
This project is a **passion-driven effort** to build a high-quality backend for a features-focused website. Leveraging **TypeScript** and **Node.js**, it combines type safety with the flexibility of JavaScript to create a reliable foundation. Inspired by the elegance of **Chronos**, we’re crafting a system that’s both developer-friendly and ready for real-world use.

## **Purpose**
The goal is to create a **robust backend system** to support a features-focused website. Drawing from **Chronos’ seamless performance**, this project handles data, APIs, and business logic with flexibility and future growth in mind.

## **Features (Planned & In Progress)**
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Efficiently manage and serve content.
- **API-Driven Design**: RESTful endpoints for seamless frontend integration.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built to grow, inspired by Chronos’ backend approach.
- **User Interaction Support**: Logic for user accounts and engagement (details TBD).

## **Backend Inspiration**
This project is influenced by the backend of [Chronos](https://chronos.framer.website/), a modern website built with **Framer**. We aim to mirror its efficiency and modularity while crafting our own unique system.

## **Current Status**
- **Frontend**: Not yet implemented—watch this space!
- **Backend**: In active development with core features being built.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Language**: **TypeScript** (running on **Node.js**)
- **Framework**: **Express.js**
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL**
- **Hosting**: **Microsoft Azure**
